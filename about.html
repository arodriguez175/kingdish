                <p>Since 2010, KingDish has been serving the Baltimore area by creating more intimate and less hurried dining experiences. We pride ourselves on our connected community environment that serves exquisite wines and locally sourced farm-to-table food. Our dishes are best described as ‘creative meets modern.’ Dress it up or dress it down, we welcome you as you are!</p>
                <p>While our craveable, must-have-again-and-again food is a draw, we know it’s not just about the eats — it’s about the way you’re treated. So a warm welcome accompanies every hot cup of coffee, mimosa or cold beer. And our service doesn’t stop at the front door. Because we’re committed to being your neighborhood restaurant, we’re passionate about being a good neighbor and actively support the communities we’re in through volunteer work, sponsorships and partnerships. So come as you are, eat what you love, linger and laugh as long as you’d like. In return, we promise to always bring something special to the table.</p>
